# Monstercat Visualizer

Small recreation of the Monstercat Visualizer using the [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). It's far from perfect nor done but I figured I might as well put it up already so people can poke through the code and maybe even improve it.

This project is very much inspired by [caseif's vis.js](https://github.com/caseif/vis.js).
